# Numerical Experiment: Prediction Error

This folder contains codes producing Figure 1, 3, 4, and 5 in the paper. 

Data is included in small_graphs folder.

Matlab file add_error.m contains the code generating additive observational noise. There are 5 error models and we use error model 1: randomly generated uniform noise, error model 3: additive error propotional to degree d, and error model 4: additive error propotional to the inversion of degree.
