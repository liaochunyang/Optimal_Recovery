# Figure 3.1

This folder contains codes for producing figure Fig 3.1 in my thesis. 
The main goal here is to show that we can compute the local worst-case error for any recovery map. 
We also compare the local worst-case error produced by different recovery map. 
There is no surprising that the optimal recovery map produces the smallest local worst-case error.
