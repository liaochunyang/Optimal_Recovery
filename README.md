# Optimal Recovery

This repository contains my work on Optimal Recovery: the research papers and the accompanying reproducible files. These articles are:

* Optimal recovery from inaccurate data in Hilbert spaces: regularize, but what of the parameter? With S. Foucart. | [PDF](Hilbert_error_Reg/ORHilbert_Reg.pdf) / [Reproducible](Hilbert_error_Reg/ORHilbert_Reg_repro.zip)
* Learning from non-random data in Hilbert spaces: an optimal recovery perspective. With S. Foucart, S. Shahrampour, Y. Wang. | [PDF](Non-Random/Learning_OR.pdf) / [Reproducible](Non-Random/repro_LH.zip)

For a direct access to the paper and zip files of the reproducibles, simply click on the links above. To execute these reproducibles, additional software is sometimes required, in particular:


- in MATLAB, CVX (http://cvxr.com/cvx/) may be necessary;
- in Python, CVXPY (https://www.cvxpy.org/) may be necessary.
