# Optimal Recovery

This repository contains my work on Optimal Recovery: the research papers and the accompanying reproducible files. These articles are:

* Optimal recovery from inaccurate data in Hilbert spaces: regularize, but what of the parameter? With S.Foucart. | <a href="https://github.com/liaochunyang/Optimal_Recovery/blob/main/Hilbert_error_Reg/ORHilbert_Reg.pdf" target="_blank">PDF</a> / <a href="https://github.com/liaochunyang/Optimal_Recovery/blob/main/Hilbert_error_Reg/ORHilbert_Reg_repro.zip" target="_blank">Reproducible</a>
* Learning from non-random data in Hilbert spaces: an optimal recovery perspective. With S.Foucart, S.Shahrampour, Y.Wang. | <a href="https://github.com/liaochunyang/Optimal_Recovery/blob/main/Non-Random/LearningHilbert2.pdf" target="_blank">PDF</a>


For a direct access to the paper and zip files of the reproducibles, simply click on the links above. To execute these reproducibles, additional software is sometimes required, in particular:


in MATLAB, CVX (http://cvxr.com/cvx/) may be necessary;

in Python, CVXPY (https://www.cvxpy.org/) may be necessary.
